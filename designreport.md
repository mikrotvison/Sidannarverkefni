###About TicTacToe

The player that succeeds in getting three of their mark in a row wins the game, the row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. The following example show a win by the first player, player X:

###Initial design
A class diagram was made for the initial design we had in mind. This diagram gives a good overview over the classes for the game, their attributes, operations and methods. It shows the relationship between the classes and how decision was made about the branches to use. While programming the game the class diagram was used, but with that in mind that it could change.
